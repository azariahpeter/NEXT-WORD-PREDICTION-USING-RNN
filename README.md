# NEXT-WORD-PREDICTION-USING-RNN
A next word predictor using multiple Architectures. We explore all possible architectures while implementing a Next word predictor. We will use a book from the "Gutenberg project" to train our data on. We will rank each model by the amount of words it can generate to make a sensible sentence.

The models in FOCUS:
- SimpleRNN
- LSTM
- GRU
- Deep RNN
- Deep LSTM
- Deep GRU
- Bidirectional RNN
